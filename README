This is a project I'm using to get more familiar with classes in Ruby and how objects relate and interact with one another.

I only execute commands from the command line and no data is stored once I exit the interactive Ruby Environment.

Hopefully, when I get a better understanding and a working prototype I'll move this project over into a web browser.  Instead of using text to describe objects I'll use images.  But I don't want to get ahead of myself...

I currently use the Player script (player.rb) as follows:
$ irb
$ require './player'
$ x = Player.new
$ x.ftmiss
$ x.ftmake
$ x.block
$ x.threemake
$ x.display #=> prints out stats for player x
