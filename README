This is a project I'm using to get more familiar with classes in Ruby and how objects relate and interract with one another

I currently use this Player script (player.rb) as follows:
$ irb
$ require './player'
$ x = Player.new
$ x.ftmiss
$ x.ftmake
$ x.block
$ x.threemake
$ x.display #=> prints out stats for player x
